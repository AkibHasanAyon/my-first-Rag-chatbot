    "question": "Why is liver disease a major concern in Bangladesh?",
    "answer": "Liver disease is a major concern in Bangladesh because it is one of the most densely populated countries in the world and faces significant challenges in managing the health of its population. With limited healthcare resources and a high burden of infectious and non-communicable diseases, liver disease has emerged as a major public health concern. The situation is made considerably worse by the increase in viral illnesses like Hepatitis B and C as well as the restricted availability of medical facilities."
